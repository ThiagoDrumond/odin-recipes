        <li>1 egg, beaten </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk </li>
        <li>3 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. 
            Stir in garlic and onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, 
            about 2 minutes. Pour in diced tomatoes and sugar. Increase heat to medium-high, 
            and bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering for 10 minutes, 
            stirring occasionally. Once the sauce has simmered, stir in the cream and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
            Simmer for an additional 3 minutes. Lower heat and keep sauce warm
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir together bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, and dried oregano; set aside. 
            In a small bowl, whisk together egg and 2 tablespoons milk until blended. 
            Dip chicken breasts into the egg, then press into breadcrumb mixture to coat both sides, 
            shaking off excess.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add chicken breasts and cook on both sides until they reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 
            and the bread crumb crust is golden brown, about 10 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            To serve, spoon sauce over chicken and top with Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. 
            Let stand a few minutes until the cheese has melted from the heat of the sauce.
